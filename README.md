# Blinkit Sales Analytics Dashboard | Retail Performance (Power BI)

## Overview

An interactive Power BI solution built to analyze retail sales performance, product category trends, and outlet-level metrics for a quick-commerce grocery delivery platform. This dashboard delivers actionable insights into revenue drivers and operational efficiency to support strategic retail decisions.

## Business Context

Quick-commerce platforms operate in fast-paced, competitive markets where margins are tight and customer expectations are high. Success depends on understanding demand patterns, optimizing outlet operations, and tracking product performance in real time. Business leaders need reliable analytics to drive inventory decisions, refine outlet strategies, and boost overall sales effectiveness.

## Project Objectives

- Evaluate total and average sales metrics across the business
- Identify high-performing product categories and revenue contributors
- Assess outlet performance segmented by size, type, and geographic location
- Enable stakeholders to make informed, data-backed retail and operational decisions

## Technology Stack

Visualization & Development:
- Power BI Desktop – Primary platform for dashboard creation and data visualization
- Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation workflows
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom KPIs, calculated measures, and dynamic analytical logic
- Data Modeling – Relational structure connecting sales, products, outlets, and time dimensions

## Data Source & Methodology

This dashboard represents an end-to-end Power BI project developed independently, applying comprehensive data analysis techniques including data transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive design.

The underlying dataset and business scenario were sourced from a publicly available on YouTube, serving as a practice dataset to replicate real-world retail analytics challenges. All measures, transformations, visuals, and analytical insights were created from scratch as part of portfolio development.
